λ help


-- Music is Math
-- To kick off let's try some maths out. Up there you can type in Haskell expressions.
-- Try this out: 5 + 7

λ 5+7
12 :: Num a => a


-- Your first Haskell expression
-- Well done, you typed it perfect! You got back the number 12. Just what we wanted.
-- Let's try something completely different. Type in your name like this: "chris"

λ "Dave"
"Dave" :: [Char]


-- Types of values
-- Hi there, Dave! That's a pretty name. Honest. You're getting the hang of this!
-- Each time, you're getting back the value of the expression. So far, just a number and a list of characters.
-- You can have lists of other stuff, too. Let's see your lottery numbers: [42,13,22]

λ [42, 13, 22]
[42,13,22] :: Num t => [t]


-- Lesson 1 done already!
-- Great, you made a list of numbers! If you win we'll split the winnings, right?
-- Let's see what you've learned so far:
--    1. How to write maths and lists of things.
-- You can do stuff with lists. Maybe you want the lottery numbers sorted in the right order, try this: sort [42,13,22]

λ sort [42,13,22]
[13,22,42] :: (Num a, Ord a) => [a]


-- We put the funk in function
-- Congratulations, you just used a function. They're how you get things done in Haskell.
-- As you might've guessed, we got back [13,22,42].
-- Ever wanted an evil twin nemesis? Me too. Luckily, you can sort lists of characters, or strings, in the same way as numbers! sort "chris"

λ sort "chris"
"chirs" :: [Char]


-- Tuples, because sometimes one value ain't enough!
-- Watch out for chirs! You should keep their credentials for the police.
-- My nemesis is 28 years of age: (28,"chirs")

λ (28,"chirs")
(28,"chirs") :: Num t => (t, [Char])


-- We'll keep them safe, don't worry about it.
-- Is 28 a normal age for a super-villain?
-- You just wrote a tuple. It's a way to keep a bunch of values together in Haskell. You can put as many as you like in there:
--    - (1,"hats",23/35)
--    - ("Shaggy","Daphnie","Velma")
-- Actually, let's say our villain is (28,"chirs"), how do you get their age?
-- fst (28,"chirs")

λ fst (28,"chirs")
28 :: Num a => a


-- Lesson 2 done! Wow, great job!
-- Good job! You got the age back from the tuple! Didn't even break a sweat, did you? The fst function just gets the first value. It's called "fst" because it's used a lot in Haskell so it really needs to be short!
-- Time to take a rest and see what you learned:
--    - Functions can be used on lists of any type.
--    - We can stuff values into tuples.
--    - Getting the values back from tuples is easy.
-- Now let's say you want to use a value more than once, how would you do it? To make our lives easier, we can say:
-- let x = 4 in x * x

λ let x = 4 in x * x
16 :: Num a => a


-- Let them eat cake
-- You just bound a variable. That is, you bound x to the expression 4, and then you can write x in some code (the body) and it will mean the same as if you'd written 4.
-- It's like this: let var = expression in body
-- The in part just separates the expression from the body.
-- For example try: let x = 8 * 10 in x + x
-- So if we wanted to get the age of our villain, we could do:
-- let villain = (28,"chirs") in fst villain

λ let villain = (28,"chirs") in fst villain
28 :: Num a => a


-- Basics over, let's go!
-- Next, let's take a short detour to learn about syntactic sugar. Try typing this out:
-- 'a' : []
-- Or skip to lesson4 to learn about functions, the meat of Haskell!

λ 'a' : []
"a" :: [Char]


-- You constructed a list!
-- Well done, that was tricky syntax. You used the (:) function. It takes two values, some value and a list, and constructs a new list out of them. We call it 'cons' for short.
-- 'a' is the character 'a', [] is an empty list. So tacking 'a' at the start of an empty list just makes a list ['a']!
-- But thankfully we don't have to type out 'a' : 'b' : [] every time we want to make a list of characters; we can use syntactic sugar and just write ['a','b']. Don't believe me, check this!
-- 'a' : 'b' : [] == ['a','b']

λ 'a' : 'b' : [] == ['a','b']
True :: Bool


-- You're on fire!
-- You're handling this syntax really well, nice!
-- You just got a boolean value back, and it said True. That means they're equal!
-- One final demonstration on syntactic sugar for now:
-- ['a','b','c'] == "abc"

λ ['a','b','c'] == "abc"
True :: Bool


-- Lesson 3 over! Syntactic sugar is sweet
-- Let's have a gander at what you learned:
--    - In 'a' : [], : is really just another function, just clever looking.
--    - Pretty functions like this are written like (:) when you talk about them.
--    - A list of characters ['a','b'] can just be written "ab". Much easier!
-- Phew! You're getting pretty deep! Your arch nemesis, chirs, is gonna try to steal your pizza! Let's learn a bit more about functions and passing them around. Try this:
-- map (+1) [1..5]

λ map (+1) [1..5]
[2,3,4,5,6] :: (Enum b, Num b) => [b]


-- Functions: Expanded fo' real
-- Here's where the magic begins!
-- You just passed the (+1) function to the map function.
-- You can try other things like (remember: click to insert them):
--    - map (*99) [1..10]
--    - map (/5) [13,24,52,42]
--    - filter (>5) [62,3,25,7,1,9]
-- Note that a tuple is different to a list because you can do this:
-- (1,"George")

λ (1,"George")
(1,"George") :: Num t => (t, [Char])


-- Lists and Tuples
-- You can only have a list of numbers or a list of characters, whereas in a tuple you can throw anything in!
-- We've also seen that you can make a new list with (:) that joins two values together, like:
-- 1 : [2,3]
-- But we can't do this with tuples! You can only write a tuple and then look at what's inside. You can't make new ones on the fly like a list.
-- Let's write our own functions! It's really easy. How about something simple:
-- let square x = x * x in square 52

λ let square x = x * x in square 52
2704 :: Num a => a


-- Let there be functions
-- Nice one! I think you're getting used to the let syntax.
-- You defined a function. You can read it as, as for a given parameter called x, square of x is x * x.
-- Some others you can try are:
--    - let add1 x = x + 1 in add1 5
--    - let second x = snd x in second (3,4)
-- Let's go crazy and use our square function with map:
-- let square x = x * x in map square [1..10]


λ let square x = x * x in map square [1..10]
[1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100] :: (Enum b, Num b) => [b]


-- Let there be functions
-- That's so cool! You described a simple function square and then you just passed it to another function (map) and got back [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100], exactly what you expected!
-- Haskell is pretty good at composing things together like this. Some other things you can try are:
--    - let add1 x = x + 1 in map add1 [1,5,7]
--    - let take5s = filter (==5) in take5s [1,5,2,5,3,5]
--    - let take5s = filter (==5) in map take5s [[1,5],[5],[1,1]]
-- Did you get back what you expected?
-- One more example for text; how do you upcase a letter?
-- toUpper 'a'

λ toUpper 'a'
'A' :: Char


-- Exercise time!
-- Easy! Remember: characters are written like 'a' and strings (lists of characters) are written like "a".
-- I need you to use toUpper capitalise my whole name, "Chris". Give it a try. You can do it, I believe in you!

λ map toUpper "Chris"
"CHRIS" :: [Char]


-- Lesson 4 complete!
-- Brilliant! You're making excellent progress! You just passed toUpper to map. No problem.
-- Let's go over what you've learned in this lesson:
--    - Functions like map take other functions as parameters.
--    - Functions like (+1), (>5) and square can be passed to other functions.
--    - Defining functions is just a case of writing what to do with the parameters.
-- Let's check out pattern matching; a way to get values from other values using patterns. Try this:
-- let (a,b) = (10,12) in a * 2

λ let (a,b) = (10,12) in a * 2
20 :: Num a => a


-- Pattern matching!
-- Jolly good show!
-- So you had a value (10,12) and matched it against a pattern (a,b), then you were able to do stuff with the a and b!
-- Note: Pattern matching (a,b) against (1,2) to get the a is the same as doing fst (1,2), like you did in step7!
-- A pattern always matches the way the value was originally constructed. Remember that "abc" is syntactic sugar for 'a' : 'b' : 'c' : [].
-- So you can get the characters from a string with patterns:
-- let (a:b:c:[]) = "xyz" in a

λ let (a:b:c:[]) = "xyz" in a
'x' :: Char


-- Ignoring values
-- You're getting into tricky syntax, huh? I know you can handle it!
-- If you just want some of the values, you can ignore the others with _ (underscore) like this:
-- let (a:_:_:_) = "xyz" in a
-- In fact, (a:b:c:d) is short-hand for (a:(b:(c:d))), so you can just ignore the rest in one go:
-- let (a:_) = "xyz" in a

λ let (a:_) = "xyz" in a
'x' :: Char


-- Show me the money!
-- Try to get the 'a' value from this value using pattern matching:
-- (10,"abc")

λ let (_,(a:_)) = (10,"abc") in a
'a' :: Char


-- Well done!
-- Wizard! I think you've got pattern-matching down.
-- If you're still a bit unsure, here are some other things you can try:
--    - let _:_:c:_ = "abcd" in c
--    - let [a,b,c] = "cat" in (a,b,c)
-- You can also grab a whole value and pattern match on it (have your cake and eat it too):
-- let abc@(a,b,c) = (10,20,30) in (abc,a,b,c)

λ let abc@(a,b,c) = (10,20,30) in (abc,a,b,c)
((10,20,30),10,20,30) :: (Num t, Num t1, Num t2) => ((t, t1, t2), t, t1, t2)


-- And that's the end of that chapter
-- That was easy, right?
-- Let's go over what you've learned in this lesson:
--    - Values are pattern matched, or deconstructed, by writing however they were constructed.
--    - Patterns let you use the values that you match.
--    - You can ignore whichever values you want.
--    - You can pattern match and keep hold of the original value too.
-- Okay! That's all for now. It's time to dig into some documentation! (https://www.haskell.org/documentation/)
